  - title: Declarative package management with a Brewfile
    url: https://matthiasportzel.com/brewfile/
    description: Matthias Portzel explains how he treats Brew as a declarative package manager. I tested out the solution and immediately liked it as a simple way of getting a declarative-light setup without going down the [Nix](https://www.nixos.org) rabbit hole. I've since set up both my work laptop (Mac) and personal laptop (Bluefin Linux) with a Brewfile.
