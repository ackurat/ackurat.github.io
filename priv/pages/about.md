I'm a software engineer based in Sweden. I specialize in backend development and databases, particularly Elixir and PostgreSQL, and have worked within the payment domain for quite a while. I work at [Kivra](https://www.kivra.com), where I write payment related backend services in Elixir (and sometimes Erlang). You can find me on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/ackurat) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamliliemark).
